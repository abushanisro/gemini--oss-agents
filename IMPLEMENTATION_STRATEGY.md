## Strategic Approach

### Guiding Principles

1. **Impact Over Effort**: Prioritize high-impact, low-effort improvements first
2. **Quality Over Quantity**: Better to excel in fewer areas than mediocre everywhere
3. **Community-First**: Engage early and often with maintainers
4. **Documentation-Led**: Document first, code second

## Conclusion

This implementation strategy provides a structured, phased approach to enhancing Gemini integration across four major OSS agent tools. By focusing on high-impact improvements, engaging early with maintainers, and delivering value incrementally, we can significantly improve the Gemini ecosystem while staying within the 175-350 hour project scope.

The strategy is flexible and can be adjusted based on:
- API capabilities discovered during testing
- Maintainer feedback and priorities
- Community needs and requests
- Available time and resources

Success will be measured not just by lines of code or PRs merged, but by the real-world impact: enabling developers to build better, more robust AI agents with Gemini.

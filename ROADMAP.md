- [ ] Add streaming support where missing
- [ ] Improve error handling and validation
- [ ] Add safety settings configuration
- [ ] Implement token counting utilities

## Phase 3: Implementation - Major Features (Est. 60-100 hours)

### Week 5-8: Core Feature Development
- [ ] Multimodal input support
  - Image processing in LangChain
  - Video support in LlamaIndex
  - Audio inputs across tools
- [ ] Advanced function calling
  - Parallel function calls
  - Nested tool use
  - Custom tool definitions
- [ ] Context caching implementation
- [ ] Code execution support
- [ ] Grounding with Google Search

### Week 8-10: Tool-Specific Enhancements
- [ ] LangChain: Enhanced chains and agents
- [ ] LlamaIndex: Improved query engines
- [ ] CrewAI: Multi-agent coordination
- [ ] Composio: Extended tool catalog

## Phase 4: Documentation & Examples (Est. 30-50 hours)

### Week 10-12: Documentation
- [ ] Write comprehensive integration guides
- [ ] Create API reference documentation
- [ ] Develop troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Document best practices

### Week 12-14: Code Examples
- [ ] Basic examples for each tool (8-10 examples)
- [ ] Intermediate use cases (8-10 examples)
- [ ] Advanced multi-tool workflows (5-8 examples)
- [ ] Real-world application examples (5-8 examples)

## Phase 5: Testing & Quality Assurance (Est. 20-40 hours)

### Week 14-16: Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for all implementations
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Cross-tool compatibility testing

## Phase 6: Community Engagement & Contribution (Est. 25-40 hours)

### Week 16-18: Open Source Contribution
- [ ] Prepare pull requests for each tool
- [ ] Engage with maintainers
- [ ] Address review feedback
- [ ] Documentation PRs
- [ ] Create issues for larger discussions

### Ongoing: Community Support
- [ ] Monitor GitHub issues
- [ ] Answer community questions
- [ ] Create tutorial videos/blog posts
- [ ] Present at meetups or conferences

## Success Metrics

1. **Integration Completeness**
   - All major Gemini features supported in each tool
   - Feature parity across tools where applicable

2. **Documentation Quality**
   - Clear, comprehensive guides
   - 30+ working code examples
   - API reference coverage

3. **Community Impact**
   - PRs merged into upstream projects
   - Positive community feedback
   - Adoption by developers

4. **Code Quality**
   - 80%+ test coverage
   - No critical bugs
   - Performance benchmarks met

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks
1. **Upstream changes**: Tools may update, breaking our implementations
   - Mitigation: Version pinning, monitoring releases
2. **API limitations**: Gemini API may not support certain features
   - Mitigation: Document limitations, propose workarounds
3. **Maintainer feedback**: PRs may not be accepted
   - Mitigation: Early engagement, align with project goals

## Notes
- Estimates are approximate and may vary based on findings
- Prioritize quality over speed
- Maintain regular communication with tool maintainers
- Document everything for future contributors
